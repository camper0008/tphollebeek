# Website Redesign

I chose to redesign my website in order to have more clarity and prevent having to scroll a ton just to get the interesting bits.

## To-do list:

-   [x] Contact information

-   [x] Write 1-3 articles to get started

-   [x] Project overview

-   [x] Convert page to work with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) to use in project overview

-   [x] Fancy background

-   [x] Image of me somewhere

-   [ ] Technologies I have experience with

-   [ ] Quick navigation
