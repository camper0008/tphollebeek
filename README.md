# Website Redesign

I chose to redesign my website in order to have more clarity and prevent having to scroll a ton just to get the interesting bits.

## To-do list:

- [ ] Contact information

- [ ] Blog system / "project overview"

- [ ] Fancy background

- [x] Image of me somewhere

- [ ] Technologies i have experience with

- [ ] Quick navigation
